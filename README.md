**Introduction**

SherCo Grand Slam Baseball is a tabletop baseball game where you can actually position and move players on the field to see the game play out like you would in reality.

I have spent many hours since my youth in the 1970s playing SherCo, and have even created my own customized stadiums. There is an active user base, with a forum that can be found [here](http://forums.delphiforums.com/shercobaseball/).

One of the best aspects of SherCo is that since the beginning they have provided the formulas allowing you to rate any teams or players based on real (or imaginary from game play) statistics, so you can create your own leagues and track players and update their ratings over time, or go back and rate an entire season so you can replay it any way you'd like.

This Python code will allow you to specify any year (though the fielding ratings would only be accurate for any season since 1950, based on the current code), and output an Excel file with the player ratings from each team that played during that year. Player statistics are scraped from baseball-reference.com. **Note that the rating system is based on the SherCo PLUS variant of the game**, which has a more diverse and robust system of play than Classic SherCo.
